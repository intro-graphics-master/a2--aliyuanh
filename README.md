# Assignment #2

### Step 1:  Begin with these steps to repository setup:

1. By now you have followed the link to create your assignment repository, which must look like **a2-githubusername**.  Don't generate it more than once.

2. Copy this repository to your computer as you did last time.  Find the big green button on the page that says "Clone or download", and either activate GitHub Desktop or just download it as a .zip.

### Step 2:  Test run your project.  

1. Go to your folder.

   ![icons](docs/image-01.png?)
 
2.  Click open "host.bat" or "host.command" to run the host as you did before.

3.  Open a new browser window to "localhost:8000".

4.  You should see a spinning cube animation.  If not, check the error console and ask on Piazza.

### Step 3:  Edit the code (graded part)

1.  Press F12 (Windows) or Cmd+Option+i (Mac) to open the Chrome developer tools panel (DevTools).

   
   
### Step 7:  Continue the next steps to turn in assignment 2 on CCLE:

1.  Zip up all your files (except for the "docs" folder, please leave that out) in a single .zip file, which you will name after your student UID.  Turn in your .zip on CCLE, where we will add a place to do so.

2.  You can push your changes to GitHub too if you want.  Or you can just keep your repo copy local to your machine.  Either way, it can be helpful to commit your code to your repo whenever it works, so you can always go back to that state using GitHub desktop's buttons, or easily see what changes you've made since then.
